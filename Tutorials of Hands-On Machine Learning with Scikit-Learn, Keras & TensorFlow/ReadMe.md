我在2020年初在[贝氏计算](https://openbayes.com/)做了一段实习，主要对机器学习进行了一定的入门，参考书籍为 *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, 2nd edition* by *Aurélien Géron*. 并用Jupyter Notebook对其写了一部分MarkDown读书笔记，其中参考了该书的源码。

In early 2020, I did an internship in [Bayesian Computing] (https://openbayes.com/), mainly for an introduction to machine learning, the reference book is *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, 2nd edition* by * Aurélien Géron *. I wrote several MarkDown notes with Jupyter Notebook, which referenced the source code in the book.
